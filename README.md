# EnvironmentHelper (name tbd)
beat saber library something something disable components of vanilla environments

## What is this?
this is a tool for other mods that need to hide certain objects in the game's environment. probably useful for something like CustomPlatforms (i looked at the environment removal code for CustomPlatforms and quickly looked away)

this will be built in a modular way that will allow people to add new environments when needed. it will handle not implemented environments without messing up the game so it can still be used for testing without the need to be updated.

### Functions
exact functionality is to be decided.
- Hide non-light geometry (buildings, walls, etc.)
- Hide lights
- Hide player standing area
- Replace opaque light materials with transparent ones?
